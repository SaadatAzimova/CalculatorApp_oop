CalculatorApp - JavaFX Calculator Application
  This is a simple JavaFX-based calculator application built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
  The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with appropriate error handling (e.g., division by zero).

How to Run the Calculator Application
    1.Clone the repository: Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.
    2.Open the project: Use your preferred IDE to open the CalculatorApp project folder.
    3.Configure JavaFX: If you're using JDK 11 or higher, make sure you have added the required JavaFX SDK. Configure your IDE to include JavaFX libraries in the module path.
    4.Run the Application: Execute the CalculatorApp class (or the Main class if created separately) from your IDE to launch the calculator.

How to Use the Calculator
    1.Input numbers: Press any of the digit buttons (0-9) to input numbers. The digits will be displayed in the text field.
    2.Choose an operator: After entering the first number, press one of the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to select an arithmetic operation.
    3.Input the second number: After selecting the operator, input the second number.
    4.Get the result: Press the = button to perform the calculation. The result will be displayed in the text field.
    5.Clear the input: To clear the current input and reset the calculator, press the Clear button. This will clear all fields and prepare the calculator for a new operation.
